Shoot-em-up game for Pygame engine

This is my attempt at learning to develop a game using the PyGame engine.

Feel free to fork this and do whatever you want with the code, completely re-write it if you want. I hope this is of any use to anyone wishing to create a game and needs a template. I'd be very interested in any suggestions people have and to see what they can create using the existing code.
